   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cvai2
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv311
   .\venv311\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv311
   source venv311/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development dependencies
   ```

   ```

5. **Set up Google Cloud credentials**
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials.json"

   # On macOS/Linux
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials.json"
   ```

6. **Start the function locally**
   ```bash
   functions-framework --target=cv_optimizer
   ```

## 📡 API Usage

### Authentication

The API supports two authentication methods:

1. **Supabase JWT Authentication** (For web clients)
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your-supabase-jwt-token>
   ```

2. **GCP IAM Authentication** (For service accounts and GCP services)
   Generate an access token for your service account and include it in the Authorization header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your-service-account-token>
   ```
   See [IAM_AUTHENTICATION.md](IAM_AUTHENTICATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Endpoint

`POST https://YOUR_FUNCTION_URL`

### Request Format

The API accepts `multipart/form-data` with the following fields:

- `cv_file`: The CV document file (PDF or DOCX)
- `task`: The task to perform (`parsing`, `ps`, `cs`, `ka`, `role`, `scoring`)
- `jd`: (Optional) Job description text or URL
- `section`: (Optional) Specific section to analyze
- `model`: (Optional) Gemini model to use (defaults to `gemini-2.0-flash-001`)

Example cURL request:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_FUNCTION_URL \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Request-ID: unique-request-id" \
  -F "cv_file=@/path/to/your/cv.pdf" \
  -F "task=parsing" \
  -F "model=gemini-2.0-flash-001"
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Guide

### React + Vite Integration

#### 1. API Client Setup

Create a dedicated API client using Axios or Fetch:

```typescript
// src/services/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;

export const cvApi = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
  },
});

// Add auth interceptor
cvApi.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('supabase_token');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

#### 2. Type Definitions

Define TypeScript interfaces for API responses:

```typescript
// src/types/cv.ts
export interface CVData {
  contact_info: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone?: string;
    location?: string;
  };
  experience: Array<{
    title: string;
    company: string;
    duration: string;
    description: string;
  }>;
  education: Array<{
    degree: string;
    institution: string;
    year: string;
  }>;
  skills: string[];
}

export interface CVScore {
  overall: number;
  skills_match: number;
  experience_match: number;
  education_match: number;
}

export interface CVResponse {
  cv_data: CVData;
  scores?: CVScore;
  personal_statement?: string;
}
```

#### 3. React Hooks

Create custom hooks for API interactions:

```typescript
// src/hooks/useCVOptimizer.ts
import { useState } from 'react';
import { cvApi } from '../services/api';
import { CVResponse } from '../types/cv';

export const useCVOptimizer = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const analyzeCV = async (
    file: File,
    task: 'parsing' | 'ps' | 'cs' | 'ka' | 'role' | 'scoring',
    jd?: string
  ): Promise<CVResponse | null> => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);

      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('cv_file', file);
      formData.append('task', task);
      if (jd) formData.append('jd', jd);

      const response = await cvApi.post<CVResponse>('', formData);
      return response.data;
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred');
      return null;
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return { analyzeCV, loading, error };
};
```

#### 4. Component Example

Example React component using the hook:

```typescript
// src/components/CVUploader.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useCVOptimizer } from '../hooks/useCVOptimizer';
import { CVResponse } from '../types/cv';

export const CVUploader = () => {
  const [result, setResult] = useState<CVResponse | null>(null);
  const { analyzeCV, loading, error } = useCVOptimizer();

  const handleFileUpload = async (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const file = event.target.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;

    const response = await analyzeCV(file, 'parsing');
    if (response) {
      setResult(response);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" accept=".pdf,.docx,.txt" onChange={handleFileUpload} />
      {loading && <div>Analyzing CV...</div>}
      {error && <div className="error">{error}</div>}
      {result && (
        <div>
          <h2>Analysis Results</h2>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 5. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your Vite project:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Development
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com  # Production
```

#### 6. Error Handling

Implement comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
// src/utils/errorHandling.ts
export class APIError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public status?: number,
    public code?: string
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'APIError';
  }
}

export const handleAPIError = (error: unknown): APIError => {
  if (error instanceof APIError) return error;
  
  if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
    return new APIError(
      error.response?.data?.message || 'API request failed',
      error.response?.status,
      error.response?.data?.code
    );
  }
  
  return new APIError('An unexpected error occurred');
};
```

#### 7. Testing

Example test setup using Vitest:

```typescript
// src/components/__tests__/CVUploader.test.tsx
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { CVUploader } from '../CVUploader';
import { vi } from 'vitest';

describe('CVUploader', () => {
  it('handles file upload and displays results', async () => {
    const { getByRole, findByText } = render(<CVUploader />);
    
    const file = new File(['test content'], 'test.pdf', { type: 'application/pdf' });
    const input = getByRole('file');
    
    fireEvent.change(input, { target: { files: [file] } });
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(findByText('Analysis Results')).toBeTruthy();
    });
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Implement token refresh logic
   - Store tokens securely (preferably in HttpOnly cookies)
   - Handle token expiration gracefully

2. **File Upload**
   - Implement file size limits
   - Validate file types client-side
   - Show upload progress
   - Handle large files with chunked uploads if needed

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Handle network issues gracefully

4. **Performance**
   - Implement request caching where appropriate
   - Use request debouncing for frequent operations
   - Optimize file uploads with compression
   - Implement proper loading states

5. **Security**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Use secure headers
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines

# IAM Authentication for CV Optimizer Function

This guide explains how to use IAM authentication with the CV Optimizer Cloud Function.

## Authentication Methods

The function now supports two authentication methods:

1. **GCP IAM Authentication** - For service accounts and GCP-managed identities
2. **Supabase JWT Authentication** - For web clients (fallback)

## Setting Up IAM Authentication

### 1. Configure the Service Account

The function will only accept requests from service accounts that have the `cloudfunctions.invoker` role:

```bash
# Add the invoker role to the service account
gcloud functions add-iam-policy-binding cv_optimizer \
  --gen2 \
  --region=europe-west2 \
  --member=serviceAccount:YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@appspot.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role=roles/cloudfunctions.invoker

# For your frontend service account:
gcloud functions add-iam-policy-binding cv_optimizer \
  --gen2 \
  --region=europe-west2 \
  --member=serviceAccount:YOUR_FRONTEND_SERVICE@appspot.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role=roles/cloudfunctions.invoker
```

### 2. Authenticate API Requests

When making requests from a service account, you need to:

1. Generate an access token for the service account
2. Include the token in the `Authorization` header

## Example Code (Python)

```python
import google.auth
import google.auth.transport.requests
import requests

# Get credentials for the default service account
credentials, project = google.auth.default()
auth_req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
credentials.refresh(auth_req)
token = credentials.token

# Call the function with the token
response = requests.post(
    "https://cv-optimizer-jfhhzkvnca-nw.a.run.app", 
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
    data={"task": "parsing"}
)
```

## Example with Frontend Integration

For a frontend app using Google Cloud, you have two options:

### Option 1: Client-side Authentication

If your frontend runs on Firebase or App Engine, use the Identity Platform to get a token:

```javascript
// Using Firebase Authentication
import { getAuth, getIdToken } from "firebase/auth";

async function callCVOptimizerFunction() {
  const auth = getAuth();
  const token = await getIdToken(auth.currentUser);
  
  const response = await fetch("https://cv-optimizer-jfhhzkvnca-nw.a.run.app", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: formData
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
```

### Option 2: Backend Proxy

Use a backend service with a service account to proxy requests to the function:

```javascript
// Frontend calls your backend proxy
async function callBackendProxy() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/cv-optimizer", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
```

And on your backend proxy:

```python
# Backend proxy with service account authentication
@app.route("/api/cv-optimizer", methods=["POST"])
def proxy_to_cv_optimizer():
    # Get service account token
    credentials, _ = google.auth.default()
    auth_req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
    credentials.refresh(auth_req)
    token = credentials.token
    
    # Forward the request
    response = requests.post(
        "https://cv-optimizer-jfhhzkvnca-nw.a.run.app",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
        data=request.form,
        files=request.files
    )
    
    return jsonify(response.json())
```

## Testing IAM Authentication

Use the included `test_iam_auth.py` script to test authentication:

```bash
python test_iam_auth.py
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **401 Unauthorized** - Check that the service account has the `cloudfunctions.invoker` role
2. **403 Forbidden** - Check that the token is valid and not expired
3. **Check logs** - Look at Cloud Functions logs for detailed authentication errors

<input1>
  <task>
  You must optimize the core skills section of a CV/résumé provided in the `cv` section of this prompt, with reference to the job description in the `jd` section. 
  <section>
  <${section}>
  </section>
  Your task is to extract and enhance the skills section, returning a valid JSON object that adheres to the response_schema. Focus on matching skills to the job requirements while maintaining truthfulness.
  </task>
  <instructions>
  ### Core Skills Optimization Guidelines
  #### Extraction Requirements
  1. Extract all relevant skills from the source CV
  2. Maintain data fidelity - only use skills explicitly mentioned in the CV
  3. Map each skill to appropriate proficiency levels:
    - Beginner: Basic knowledge, limited practical experience
    - Average: Regular usage with fundamental understanding
    - Intermediate: Solid experience, comfortable with common applications
    - Advanced: Deep understanding, can handle complex scenarios
    - Expert: Extensive knowledge, acknowledged authority on the subject
  4. Categorize each skill as either:
    - "hard" (technical skills, measurable abilities, software competencies)
    - "soft" (interpersonal qualities, character traits, people skills)
  #### Job Alignment Priorities
  1. Prioritize skills that directly match the job description requirements
  2. Elevate skills that demonstrate particular value for the target role
  3. Include transferable skills that may apply to the new position
  4. Keep industry-specific terminology if relevant to the target position
  #### Skill Standardization Rules
  1. Normalize skill names (e.g., "React.js" → "React")
  2. Remove duplicates and closely related variations
  3. Convert vague descriptors into specific, recognized skill names
  4. Break compound skills into separate, distinct entries when appropriate
  5. Include only the most relevant skills, maximum of 14 distinct skills
  #### Feedback Guidelines
  - Include 3-5 specific strengths of the candidate's current skills presentation relevant to the target role
  - Provide 3-5 actionable suggestions for improving skills presentation and alignment with job requirements
  - Base all feedback on actual content in the CV compared to the job description
  #### Response Structure
  Return a JSON object with:
  1. "status": Use "success" for normal results, "error" for fatal errors, "partial" for partial success
  2. "errors": Array of error objects (null if no errors)
  3. "data.skills": Array of skill objects, each containing:
    - "name": The standardized skill name
    - "proficiency": One of "Beginner", "Average", "Intermediate", "Advanced", or "Expert"
    - "skillType": Either "hard" or "soft"
  4. "data.feedback": Object containing:
    - "strengths": Array of strengths in the skills presentation
    - "areas_to_improve": Array of suggestions for improvement
  #### Error Handling
  If skills section cannot be properly extracted or processed:
  1. Set "status" to "error" or "partial" as appropriate
  2. Include relevant error objects in the "errors" array
  3. Return as much valid skills data as possible in the "data" object
  </instructions>

  ### Core Skills Optimization Guidelines
  #### Extraction Requirements
  1. Extract all relevant skills from the source CV
  2. Maintain data fidelity - only use skills explicitly mentioned in the CV
  3. Map each skill to appropriate proficiency levels:
    - Beginner: Basic knowledge, limited practical experience
    - Average: Regular usage with fundamental understanding
    - Intermediate: Solid experience, comfortable with common applications
    - Advanced: Deep understanding, can handle complex scenarios
    - Expert: Extensive knowledge, acknowledged authority on the subject

    - "hard" (technical skills, measurable abilities, software competencies)
    - "soft" (interpersonal qualities, character traits, people skills)
  #### Job Alignment Priorities
  1. Prioritize skills that directly match the job description requirements
  2. Elevate skills that demonstrate particular value for the target role
  3. Include transferable skills that may apply to the new position
  4. Keep industry-specific terminology if relevant to the target position
  #### Skill Standardization Rules
  1. Normalize skill names (e.g., "React.js" → "React")
  2. Remove duplicates and closely related variations
  3. Convert vague descriptors into specific, recognized skill names
  4. Break compound skills into separate, distinct entries when appropriate
  5. Include only the most relevant skills, maximum of 14 distinct skills
  #### Feedback Guidelines
  - Include 3-5 specific strengths of the candidate's current skills presentation relevant to the target role
  - Provide 3-5 actionable suggestions for improving skills presentation and alignment with job requirements
  - Base all feedback on actual content in the CV compared to the job description
  #### Response Structure
  Return a JSON object with:
  1. "status": Use "success" for normal results, "error" for fatal errors, "partial" for partial success
  2. "errors": Array of error objects (null if no errors)
  3. "data.skills": Array of skill objects, each containing:
    - "name": The standardized skill name
    - "proficiency": One of "Beginner", "Average", "Intermediate", "Advanced", or "Expert"
    - "skillType": Either "hard" or "soft"
  4. "data.feedback": Object containing:
    - "strengths": Array of strengths in the skills presentation
    - "areas_to_improve": Array of suggestions for improvement
  #### Error Handling
  If skills section cannot be properly extracted or processed:
  1. Set "status" to "error" or "partial" as appropriate
  2. Include relevant error objects in the "errors" array
  3. Return as much valid skills data as possible in the "data" object

        # CV Parser Evaluation
        ## Strengths
        - **Comprehensive data extraction**: Successfully parsed a complex CV with concurrent roles and diverse experience
        - **Multiple role handling**: Excellent organization of overlapping positions (freelance, teaching, co-founding)
        - **Career progression**: Properly captured progression within organizations (Creative Agency Network)
        - **Publications handling**: Accurately categorized different publication types with correct metadata
        - **Achievements extraction**: Well-structured achievements with quantifiable metrics (1.2M views, 340% above average engagement)
        - **Skill categorization**: Appropriate proficiency levels and hard/soft distinctions for 14 skills
        - **International formatting**: Proper handling of UK phone number and address format
        - **Link extraction**: Successfully parsed and formatted professional URLs
        - **Date consistency**: Maintained appropriate date formats throughout
        ## Notes
        - Parser effectively transformed a non-standard, creatively formatted CV into structured data
        - Appropriate prioritization of professional over personal contact information
        - Correctly distinguished between recent experience and earlier career positions
        - Good judgment in headline creation, focusing on specialization
        - All character limits respected (headline, summary, highlights)
        ## Minor Considerations
        - Professional memberships field is null, though "Women in Data UK" mentorship could potentially be classified here
        - Only primary UK phone number included when CV listed both UK and US numbers
        - "Digital Nomad" current location status not reflected, though permanent address correctly used
        The parser demonstrates excellent performance with complex, non-standard CV formats while maintaining accuracy and proper structuring according to the schema requirements.
        ## Score: 98/100

   ## Strengths
   - **Expanded Summary**: Added valuable context about working with international teams and maintaining consistency across platforms
   - **Improved Highlight Language**: Enhanced the impact of bullet points through stronger action verbs and more detailed explanations
   - **Comprehensive Self-Assessment**: Included thoughtful feedback with specific strengths and actionable improvement areas
   - **Perfect JSON Structure**: Maintained valid JSON formatting with appropriate nesting and syntax
   ## Areas to Improve
   - **Date hallucination - CRITICAL ERROR - automatic 0 score**: Added month to dates ("Jan 2017" - "Dec 2020" instead of just "2017"-"2020"). Any hallucinations will automatically cause a response score of 0/100.
   - **Spelling Inconsistency**: Used "visualisation" (UK spelling) in highlights while the original used "visualization" (US spelling) - should maintain consistency
   - **Missed Implementation Opportunity**: Suggested adding specific tools and more quantifiable achievements in the feedback section, but didn't incorporate these improvements in the actual optimization
   - **Feedback Inclusion**: The feedback section is likely meant as meta-information rather than content to be included in the final CV entry
   ## Notes
   The LLM successfully enhanced the employment entry by adding professional polish and more context while preserving the core accomplishments. The self-assessment component shows good critical thinking, though it would be more valuable if the LLM had implemented some of its own suggestions. Without seeing the full CV, it's difficult to assess alignment with overall document tone and style.

   ## Strengths
   - **Data Integrity**: Maintains the exact date format from the original input (2017-2020) without hallucinating specificity
   - **Appropriate Summary Enhancement**: Adds relevant context about UX/UI expertise and cross-cultural design solutions without fabricating specific details
   - **Preserved Original Highlights**: Maintains the factual accuracy of the achievement bullet points
   - **Well-structured Feedback**: Provides thoughtful self-assessment with specific strengths and actionable improvement areas
   - **Valid JSON Format**: Maintains proper JSON structure throughout the response
   - **Consistency**: Preserves the original US spelling "visualization" throughout the document
   - **Date Correctness**: Correctly parses just the year (YYYY) date as months are not present in the input context.
   ## Areas to Improve
   - **Missed Implementation Opportunity**: Similar to the previous response, suggests improvements in the feedback section (like mentioning specific tools and methodologies) but doesn't incorporate these into the actual optimization
   ## Notes
   This response successfully enhances the employment entry while carefully avoiding hallucinations. It strikes a good balance between adding professional context and preserving factual accuracy. The LLM has clearly learned from previous mistakes regarding date formatting. The self-assessment shows good critical thinking about how the entry could be further improved, though implementing some of these suggestions directly would have demonstrated more initiative.
   ## Score (out of 100)
   95/100

   <instructions>
   ### Work Experience Optimization Guidelines
   #### Experience Extraction Requirements
   1. Extract and optimize the specific work experience entry highlighted in the `<section>` tag
   2. Maintain data fidelity - only use information explicitly stated in the source CV
   3. Structure the experience according to the schema requirements:
      - Company name (use full legal name without suffixes unless part of common name)
      - Overall employment period (start and end dates covering all roles at the company)
      - Current status (set to true only if explicitly stated as current or if end date is missing)
      - Roles array (all positions held at this company with individual start/end dates)
      - Summary of responsibilities (maximum 400 characters)
      - Key highlights/achievements (maximum 6 items, 200 characters each)
   #### Role Structuring Guidelines
   1. For each role within the company:
      - Use the exact job title as stated in the CV
      - Standardize common abbreviations (e.g., "Sr." to "Senior")
      - Include precise start and end dates for that specific position
      - Mark as current only if it's the latest role with no end date
   #### Date Formatting Rules
   1. Format all dates as "MMM YYYY" (e.g., "Jan 2020")
   2. For current positions, set end date to null and "current" flag to true
   3. For past positions, include precise end date and set "current" flag to false
   4. Maintain chronological consistency within roles (most recent first)
   #### Summary Optimization
   1. Create a concise summary (maximum 400 characters) that:
      - Focuses on scope of responsibilities relevant to the target role
      - Highlights key accountabilities and areas of oversight
      - Uses active voice and strong action verbs
      - Avoids unnecessary jargon or overly technical language unless relevant
      - Emphasizes transferable skills that align with the job description
   #### Achievements Enhancement
   1. Identify and optimize up to 6 key achievements that:
      - Demonstrate measurable impact and results (with metrics where available)
      - Follow the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
      - Begin with strong action verbs and focus on outcomes
      - Are most relevant to the requirements in the job description
      - Include quantifiable results (percentages, monetary values, time savings)
      - Each achievement should not exceed 200 characters
   #### Feedback Guidelines
   - Include 3-5 specific strengths of the candidate's current role description
   - Provide 3-5 actionable suggestions for improving the role presentation and relevance
   - Base all feedback on actual content in the CV compared to the job description
   #### Relevance Prioritization
   1. Reorder and emphasize aspects of the experience that align with the target role
   2. Place the most relevant achievements at the beginning of the highlights array
   3. Focus on responsibilities and achievements that demonstrate transferable skills
   4. Highlight industry-specific knowledge and expertise relevant to the job description
   #### Response Structure
   Return a JSON object with:
   1. "status": Use "success" for normal results, "error" for fatal errors, "partial" for partial success
   2. "errors": Array of error objects (null if no errors)
   3. "data": Object containing:
      - "company": Company name string
      - "start"/"end": Date strings in "MMM YYYY" format (end is null if current)
      - "current": Boolean indicating if this is a current position
      - "summary": Concise description of responsibilities (maximum 400 characters)
      - "highlights": Array of achievement strings (maximum 6 items, 200 characters each)
      - "roles": Array of role objects each with title, start, end, and current status
      - "feedback": Object containing:
      - "strengths": Array of strengths in the role description
      - "areas_to_improve": Array of suggestions for improvement
   #### Error Handling
   If the experience entry cannot be properly processed:
   1. Set "status" to "error" or "partial" as appropriate
   2. Include relevant error objects in the "errors" array
   3. Return as much valid data as possible in the "data" object

# Assessment of LLM Response
## Strengths
- **Factual Accuracy**: All added details are supported by the CV (company name "Inc." suffix, technologies, testing metrics)
- **Multiple Role Identification**: Correctly identifies that the user has held multiple roles within the same company and returns the correct resultant JSON structure.
- **Enhanced Technical Specificity**: Added relevant technologies (React, Redux, Node.js, Express) that showcase specific expertise
- **Improved Completeness**: Added the missing highlight about "automated testing strategies achieving 85% code coverage" from the CV
- **Maintained Quantifiable Achievements**: Preserved all important metrics (95% reduction, $2.4M savings, 78% downtime reduction)
- **Comprehensive Self-Assessment**: Provided thoughtful analysis of strengths and potential improvements
- **Valid JSON Structure**: Maintained proper formatting and structure throughout
## Areas to Improve
- **Highlight Reordering**: Changed the sequence of achievements without clear strategic reasoning
- **Implementation Gap**: The feedback suggests improvements (like adding more about scale and fintech domain knowledge) that could have been incorporated from the CV
## Notes
This response demonstrates excellent attention to detail by pulling in specific technologies and achievements that were present in the CV but not included in the original section. The LLM showed good judgment in identifying which details would strengthen the employment entry without fabricating information. It correctly identified the company name as including "Inc." based on the CV header. The addition of specific technologies and the testing achievement significantly enhances the technical specificity and value of the entry.

</role>

<rules>
### Response Format Rules
- Your response MUST be a valid JSON object that validates against the provided schema
- Structure your response according to the exact specifications in the task's response_schema
- Include all required fields, using null values only when specifically permitted
- Never include fields that aren't defined in the schema
- When asked to return lists, respect the minimum and maximum item counts specified

### Content Rules
- Detect whether the input CV uses British English (e.g., 'CV', 'organisation', '-ise' endings) or American English (e.g., 'resume', 'organization', '-ize' endings), and maintain consistency with that variant in all responses
- Never invent, fabricate, or assume factual information not present in the CV
- Do not add hard skills, qualifications, or experiences not explicitly indicated in the CV
- For optimization tasks, you may rephrase content but must maintain factual accuracy
- Preserve all dates, numbers, and measurable achievements exactly as presented
- Convert all phone numbers to international format when parsing
- Validate email addresses to ensure proper format, using null when invalid

### Task-Specific Processing
- For structured data extraction (parsing), extract all available information according to the schema definition
- For section optimization (PS, CS, KA, role), enhance the existing content while maintaining factual accuracy
- For scoring tasks, evaluate objectively against provided criteria, whether against a specific job or for general quality assessment
- Each task has specific requirements detailed in the task instructions - follow these precisely

### Error Handling
- If {cv_content} is empty, return a fatal error with appropriate status and message
- Return appropriate error objects for any data that cannot be properly processed
- When partial processing is possible, set status to "partial" and return as much valid data as possible
- Document any assumptions or limitations in your processing as appropriate

### Job Description Handling
- <jd> may be empty in some requests - in this case, perform generic optimization or assessment without job-specific matching
- When a job description is provided, leverage it for targeted optimization or evaluation
- Focus on alignment with key requirements, terminology, and priorities in the job description
- For scoring tasks without a job description, evaluate general CV quality and effectiveness
</rules>

1. Improves candidates' chances of passing ATS screening
2. Highlights relevant qualifications and achievements for target roles
3. Presents information in a clear, impactful, and professional manner
4. Provides actionable, specific feedback for continuous improvement
5. Maintains complete factual accuracy while enhancing presentation

# Testing the CV Optimizer

This directory contains the test suite for the CV Optimizer cloud function. The tests are organized into multiple categories and use pytest as the testing framework.

## Test Structure

- `tests/unit/`: Unit tests for individual modules
  - `test_document_processor.py`: Tests for the document processing functionality
  - `test_gemini_client.py`: Tests for the Gemini API client
  - `test_adk_client.py`: Tests for the ADK client
  - `test_storage.py`: Tests for the GCS storage utilities
  - `test_secret_manager.py`: Tests for the Secret Manager client
  - `test_schemas.py`: Tests for the Pydantic schema models

- `tests/integration/`: Integration tests that verify multiple components working together
  - `test_main_flow.py`: Tests for the main application flow (HTTP endpoints, authentication, etc.)

- `tests/fixtures/`: Test data files and fixtures
  - `sample_cv.txt`: A sample CV text file for testing
  - `sample_jd.txt`: A sample job description for testing

- `conftest.py`: Common pytest fixtures shared across tests

## Running Tests

### Setup

1. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Make sure you have any necessary environment variables set (or use mock objects in tests)

### Running All Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Running Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_document_processor.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/unit/test_document_processor.py::TestDocumentProcessor::test_extract_text_from_pdf
```

### Running with Coverage

```bash
pytest --cov=. 
```

This will generate a coverage report showing which parts of the code are covered by tests.

For a more detailed HTML coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

Then open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser.

## Best Practices

1. **Mock external dependencies**: Always mock external services like Google Cloud Storage, Secret Manager, and Gemini API.
2. **Use fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures in `conftest.py` for common test dependencies.
3. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for error handling, invalid inputs, and edge cases.
4. **Keep tests independent**: Tests should not depend on the state left by previous tests.
5. **Use meaningful assertions**: Make assertion messages clear to understand test failures.

## Extending the Test Suite

When adding new functionality to the codebase, follow these steps:

1. Create unit tests for the new module or function
2. Update integration tests if the new functionality affects the main application flow
3. Add any new test fixtures if needed
4. Run the full test suite to ensure nothing breaks
